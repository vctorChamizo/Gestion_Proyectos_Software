# Software Project Management - StudyApp

This project stems from the need to create an application in which, as development takes place, the software engineering methodologies are used.

The application has been developed applying agile methodologies, more specifically the Scrum methodology, making the sprints that have been necessary for the development of the project and with an interpretation of roles by the team as indicated by the Scrum manifest.

In addition, the project has been developed using continuous integration, allowing the automation of test and versioning of the application

The developed project has the functionality of providing support to the student when studying, thus being able to perform a self test that allows him to evaluate
